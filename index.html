      <h1>Nvidia</h1>
      <h3>Nvidia's history:</h3>
      <h3>
        Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[23][24][25] by Jensen Huang (CEO as
        of 2023), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously
        the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at
        AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and
        Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics
        chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems.[26][27] The three men founded
        the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner in East San Jose
        (just off Interstate 680 at the Berryessa Road interchange).[28][29] In
        1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the
        forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated
        computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was
        chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded
        general-purpose computing methods.[30] They also observed that video
        games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging
        problems and would have incredibly high sales volume; the two conditions
        do not happen very often.[30] Video games became the company's flywheel
        to reach large markets and fund huge R&D to solve massive computational
        problems.[30] With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[30] The
        company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding
        from Sequoia Capital and others.[31] Nvidia initially had no name and
        the co-founders named all their files NV, as in "next version".[30] The
        need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all
        words with those two letters, leading them to "invidia", the Latin word
        for "envy".[30] The company's original headquarters office was in
        Sunnyvale, California.[30] Nvidia's first GPU, the NV1, was optimized
        for processing quadratic primitives instead of the triangle primitives
        preferred by its competitors.[29] Then Microsoft introduced the DirectX
        platform, refused to support any other graphics software,[32] and also
        announced that its graphics software (Direct3D) would support only
        triangles.[29] In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's
        employees (then around 100) and focused the company's remaining
        resources on developing a GPU optimized for processing triangle
        primitives: the RIVA 128.[29][32] By the time the RIVA 128 was released
        in August 1997, Nvidia only had enough money left for about one month of
        payroll.[29] The sense of desperation around Nvidia during this
        difficult era of its early history gave rise to "the unofficial company
        motto": "Our company is thirty days from going out of business".[29]
        Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128s in about four months[29] and used
        the revenue to develop its next generation of products.[32] Nvidia went
        public on January 22, 1999.[33][34][35]
